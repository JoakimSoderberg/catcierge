{"name":"Catcierge","tagline":"Image recognition (to keep cat prey out) and RFID chip reader system for automated DIY cat door.","body":"The short version\r\n=================\r\nThe Catcierge project is an image recognition and cat RFID-chip reader for detecting \"gifts\" (dead or alive) and neighbour cats, made to work together with an automated cat door system. Designed for use with the Raspberry Pi including camera board (but can easily be modified to work on other systems as well).\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n==========\r\nThe Catcierge project came about to solve the problem of our cat having the nasty habit of delivering \"gifts\" to us through our cat door in the form of dead, or partly dead / fully alive rodents or birds.\r\n\r\nInstead of simply not allowing our cat to use the cat door like normal people I of course set out to find a high-tech solution to solve my perdicament.\r\n\r\nMy idea was to somehow use image recognition to lock the cat door if it had something in it's mouth. My first idea was to use Haar Cascades as is normally used for facial recognition, but instead train it to work on cats.\r\n\r\nIn the process of researching possible solutions I found the Flo Control project that instead uses a controlled envrionment to get a good profile image of the cat where the \"gift\" easily can be distingusihed. I decided to implement this idea instead.\r\n\r\nDevelopment story\r\n=================\r\nAfter replacing the window in our basement stairway with a cat door to let our cat Higgs live a more free roaming life, she soon started delivering dead (and some living) rodents and birds. Obviously this is not something we want so I decided to build an automated cat door that will shut her out when she tries to bring them inside.\r\n\r\nWhen first installing the cat door I was also worried about other neighbouring cats making visits through it (especially since, we'd had some visits when we kept our door open in the summe before our cat had time to mark her territory), so I had some plans to create an automated door that solves that problem as well, by reading the RFID chip our cat has operated into her neck. \r\n\r\nI had seen several DIY solutions of RFID readers that require the cat to wear an extra RFID chip on a collar, but that's not what I wanted. So my idea was to find a reader that supports reading the actual [ISO 11784/11785, FDX/HDX tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_11784_%26_11785) which uses another frequency compared to most generic RFID readers.\r\n\r\nThe [Rapsberry Pi][rpi]\r\n-----------------------\r\nWhen I started thinking of this project the Raspberry Pi had become available, as well as the [camera board][rpi_cam]. So I quickly decided I will use this for my project. \r\n\r\nOne problem was that [OpenCV][opencv] does not work natively with the Raspberry Pi camera which interfaces directly via the CPU. Thankfully [Pierre Raufast][rpi_opencv] fixed this problem by rewriting the raspistill program to work with OpenCV, and [Emil Valkov][emil_valkov]Â simplified this into a library that can easily be used with an API similar to the normal OpenCV camera API.\r\n\r\nBuilding the cat door\r\n---------------------\r\n![Cat door](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/catdoor01.jpg)\r\n![Cat door](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/catdoor02.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Cat door](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/catdoor03.jpg)\r\n![Cat door](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/catdoor04.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe cat door we built and installed as a replacement for our basement window was kind of a temporary solution. At first we had simply thought we would remove it for the winter and put the normal window back in since we live in northern Sweden where it easily can go down to -30C.\r\n\r\n![Cat house with extra corridor in front](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/cathouse01.jpg)\r\n\r\nHowever, since I was thinking of building this automated cat door which obvisouly would need some extra space to fit, I instead decided to build a small house in front of the cat door that's insulated so we wouldn't loose too much heat through it as well.\r\n\r\nMy idea was to have the cat first go through a small corridor that I would build in front of this small cat house, and at the end of this corridor a first cat door would be installed. This would be the cat door that I could lock automatically if any prey was detected. \r\n\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/cathouse02.jpg)\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/cathouse03.jpg)\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/cathouse04.jpg)\r\n\r\nThis design would also have the benefit of insulating the outside from the inside via two cat doors, instead of just one. I could also put in a third door at the beginning of this corridor to get even less cold air flowing in.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to develop this thing, I built the corridor in a way that made it removable, so I could easily bring it in while developing the software and testing the door locking and such. I built the frame of it in place in front of the cat house, and made it fit into it's opening.\r\n\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/corridor01.jpg)\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/corridor02.jpg)\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/corridor03.jpg)\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/corridor04.jpg)\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/corridor06.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe idea for this \"capture\" corridor was to keep the camera and electronics in half of it, and then make a small passage for the cat to actually go through in the other half. The corridor therefore needs to be wide enough so that the camera, with it's field of view, can get a good enough picture of the cats profile. \r\n\r\n![Cat corridor](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/corridor05.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe walls of the corridor that the cat walks through is made out of acrylic so that the camera can see through it. I made the roof out of plywood and placed it quite low so that shE haS to crouch when going in. This is so that the placement of the head againsT the background will be very consistent when taking the picture to match against. Also making the roof low makes it so her back rubs against the ceiling where the RFID readers will be located (she has the RFID chip in her neck).\r\n\r\nTo decide how far away the camera needed to be I persuaded my cat to keep still in front of the camera att different distances (not as easy as it sounds). The optimal distance turned out to be about 30cm. So I decided making the corridor 60cm would be enough to fit everything.\r\n\r\nLocking mechanism\r\n-----------------\r\nThe actual cat door I decided to use was a very simple store bought one with some manual plastic locking latches. I was not interested in using these for the actual locking, or buying some fancy expensive cat door with a built-in electronic locking mechanism.\r\n\r\n![Locking](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/door01.jpg)\r\n\r\nInstead my idea all a long was to use a 12V solenoid that when given power will push a small pin out. This pin will then block the door so it cannot be opened. My first idea was to build my own circuit to control this solenoid via the 3.3v [Raspberry Pi][rpi] GPIO pins. Since the solenoid requires a 12V power supply, it cannot be directly controlled via the GPIO pins.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some googling, I instead found a nice and cheap board named [Picoborg][picoborg] that lets you connect an external power supply (in my case a 12V one), and then control up to 4 devices using the RPI GPIO pins.\r\n\r\n![Locking](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/locking01.jpg)\r\n\r\n![Locking](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/locking02.jpg)\r\n![Locking](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/locking03.jpg)\r\n\r\nTo attach the solenoid next to the cat door I used my band saw to create a piece of wood that would hold it in place.\r\n\r\n[![Video of locking mechanism](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wViEUI-CRm8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wViEUI-CRm8)\r\n\r\n[Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wViEUI-CRm8)\r\n\r\nMethod of detecting\r\n-------------------\r\nSince I had found the [Flo Control project][flo_control] that had solved the problem with detecting cat prey, I knew a working method in theory for how I could detect the cats face and eventual prey. \r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to make the cat go through a corridor. On one side of the corridor there's a camera, on the other side there's a backlight. This enables us to take a well controlled picture of the cats profile. Since cats keep their prey in the mouth, we can focus on the cats snout when doing the matching. We now use a saved image of the cats snout without any prey in it, and scan the image for that, if we get a good enough match, we can be certain the cat has no prey, if not we lock the door!\r\n\r\nThis method is a lot simpler than using more advanced techniques used for pattern matching, such as haar cascades or similar things normally used for facial detection in humans. Using techniques like that it would probably be possible to make a much more compact version with the camera simply being placed above the cat door, and taking a picture of the cat face on. However, that would require a lot more time and effort, involving different lightning and weather. Keep It Simple Stupid!\r\n\r\nBacklight\r\n---------\r\n\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight01.jpg)\r\n\r\nSince the detection method I choose for this solution requires a backlight, I decided to use a 12V LED light that I then also can connect to the [Picoborg][picoborg] and be able to control it via the RPI GPIO pins. First I tried using a normal LED light for this, but it turned out that the background would not be uniform enough, giving me a bad profile picture.\r\n\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight02.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight03.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight04.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight05.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight06.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight07.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight08.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight09.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight10.jpg)\r\n![Backlight](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/backlight11.jpg)\r\n\r\nInstead I decided to tape a cheap 5m LED light strip bought on ebay on to the back of some plywood to create one big backlight. By placing a piece of acrylic with some paper taped on to it in front of it, I got a more scattered and uniform light source.\r\n\r\nRFID readers\r\n------------\r\n![RFID](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/rfid02.jpg)\r\n\r\nOur cat has an RFID chip implanted in her neck for identification. This chip cannot be read using most generic RFID readers on the market, so I had to find one able to read the [ISO 11784/11785, FDX/HDX tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_11784_%26_11785).\r\n\r\nThe commercial products meant for veterinarians and the like are crazy expensive and not very customizeable to work in a scenario like mine. But eventually I found a great little company in Australia that creates cheap animal RFID readers for ease of use in DIY projects like this. I bought two of the [FDX-B/HDX RFID Reader Writer with external antenna and USB port][rfid_cat]Â readers.\r\n\r\n![RFID](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/rfid03.jpg)\r\n\r\nMy idea was to use two RFID antennas, one on each end of the corridor enabling me to detect in which direction the cat is going, in or out. As I mentioned earlier, I made the ceiling in the corridor quite low, so that the cats back will brush against it as she walks through. This way I can get the RFID chip to come as close to the readers as possible. My first idea was to simply have the antennas lying on top of this thin roof, since the readers specs says they can read at a distance of about 10cm.\r\n\r\n![RFID](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/rfid01.jpg)\r\n\r\nHowever, from some testing it turns out I cannot read the tag unless I brush it against the cats skin, so doing it this way will not work. Most likely I could probably extend the range of the antenna by tuning it as specified in the datasheet, but this will be my last resort. In the mean time I'll try to put the antennas in a way that gives maximum contact with the cats neck.\r\n\r\n![RFID](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/rfid04.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe RFID readers doesn't come with the antenna soldered on, so I had to do that. Since the antenna wires are really thin, and it would be very easy to break the antenna, I made a small enclosure for them made out of some left over plastics from some blister packaging.\r\n\r\nHere's some tests from reading the RFID tag of my cat:\r\n\r\n![RFID](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/rfid05.jpg)\r\n\r\nSoftware\r\n--------\r\nWhen creating the matching algorithm as described above, I decided to first develop it as a prototype in the Python version of OpenCV, since this would enable me to use my laptop (a lot faster) instead of the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\n[![Youtube video of higgs](http://img.youtube.com/vi/1rPXvtY850c/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rPXvtY850c)\r\n\r\n[Youtube video of higgs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rPXvtY850c)\r\n\r\nTo test the matching I had to have some kind of input data to test against. Using some cat candy I managed to get Higgs to walk through the corridor while I had the raspivid program recording.\r\n\r\nI then used frames from this video to create the matching algorithm. Here are the steps that the matching goes through to determine if Higgs has prey in her mouth or not:\r\n\r\n### OK\r\n\r\nOriginal image:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/ok/higgs02_01original.png)\r\n\r\nTurn the image into a grayscale image:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/ok/higgs02_02gray.png)\r\n\r\nThreshold the image (Every pixel above a certain value becomes black, and the others white) so that we get a binary image:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/ok/higgs02_03binary.png)\r\n\r\nWe now remove some noise from the image:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/ok/higgs02_04nonoise.png)\r\n\r\nWe now use a previously saved image of the cats snout and scan it over the image:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/snout1080p.png)\r\n\r\nThis creates a \"heatmap\" of where this snout image matches the best on the input image. The values of this image is between 0.0 and 1.0, so that the best match on the image has the highest value. We can use this maximum value to choose a threshold of how good a match we decide is a snout with no prey in it:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/ok/higgs02_05tempmatch.png)\r\n\r\nFinally we can mark on the original image where the best match was found:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/ok/higgs02_06final.png)\r\n\r\n### Not OK\r\nTo determine the threshold for the maximum value to consider a good match, we also need some images with a negative input. That is, an image of Higgs with a mouse or other dead animal in her mouth. Since I didn't have any real input data with this scenario yet, I simply drew a mouse in her mouth in an image.\r\n\r\nSame steps as above but with a prey in her mouth:\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/notok/higgsfel02_01original.png)\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/notok/higgsfel02_02gray.png)\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/notok/higgsfel02_03binary.png)\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/notok/higgsfel02_04nonoise.png)\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/notok/higgsfel02_05tempmatch.png)\r\n\r\n![Matching](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/example/notok/higgsfel02_06final.png)\r\n\r\nFrom some test with different input images I decided that a good threshold value as mentioned above is 0.8.\r\n\r\nC-Version\r\n---------\r\nAfter creating my prototype in Python and getting it all to work, I then moved on to creating the same algorithm in a C library. I made it a library so that I can easily compile a test program to test only the algorithm on another platform than the Raspberry Pi. And then write a final program that is used for the actual image recognition running on the Raspberry Pi separately.\r\n\r\nAfter writing the C verison and using the Raspberry Pi camera board to capture the images, it was obvious that using a full resolution image at 1080p was a bit too much to handle, so instead I changed the resolution down to 320x240 and made it gray scale which made it able to capture at ~20 fps instead of 1-2 fps at the actual matching moment.\r\n\r\nThe matching is not on at all times, only when the middle part of the image becomes dark does it start to look for the cat snout. If it finds that 2 out of 4 images in row can be considered a match it will leave the door open, otherwise it will close it. All these match images can then be logged to disk for later checking for false positives and the like.\r\n\r\nI also made it possible to run external programs at different important places in the code. For instance on an RFID match, or an image recognition completing and the images being saved so you can upload them to the internet or whatever using whatever program you feel like.\r\n\r\n![Cardboard](https://raw.github.com/JoakimSoderberg/catcierge-examples/master/diy/cardboard01.jpg)\r\n\r\nWhen developing this final program I needed to test it using the live Raspberry Pi camera to see if it matched OK. Trying to persuade my cat to walk through the corridor was not really an option though, so instead I printed a frame from my input video I had captured and glued it on to some cardboard and then cut it out. I could then use this cutout to emulate the cat entering the corridor and fine tune my program using that.\r\n\r\n[flo_control]: http://www.quantumpicture.com/Flo_Control/flo_control.htm]\r\n[raspicam_cv]: https://github.com/robidouille/robidouille/tree/master/raspicam_cv\r\n[emil_valkov]: http://www.robidouille.com/\r\n[rfid_cat]: http://www.priority1design.com.au/shopfront/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=23\r\n[rpi]: http://www.raspberrypi.org/\r\n[rpi_cam]: http://www.raspberrypi.org/archives/tag/camera-board\r\n[rpi_opencv]: https://thinkrpi.wordpress.com/2013/05/22/opencv-and-camera-board-csi/\r\n[opencv]: http://opencv.org/\r\n[picoborg]: http://www.piborg.com/picoborg","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
