#
# "Input templates" can be used to generate output files containing values of internal
# catcierge variables at one or more events.
#
# The template used are defined like this:
#   input=<path to template>
#
# The special variable %template_path:<name>% below is used to refer to the location
# of the file generated from such a template, so they can be passed to scripts.
#
# If you look inside the template files you can find the name of it, and some other settings.
# To see a list of events available, as well as other settings available inside of templates
# run the command:
#
#   catcierge_grabber --eventhelp
#
# You can of course create your own custom templates for whatever format you like.
# In the compose example below we first output a script, run it, and delete it after that.
#

# Input template for match_group_done event. Generates a json file describing the match.
input=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/catcierge/templates/event.json

# Input template for compose_script.sh that will compose an image with the images
# that shows each step of the matching algorithm.
# Name of this is "compose_script" which is used below as %template_path:compose_script%
input=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/catcierge/templates/compose_script.sh.in

#
# Examples of running scripts and passing the generated template to them.
# You can pass internal catcierge variables to these using %varname%
# For a full list see catcierge_grabber --cmdhelp
#
# NOTE! The scripts are executed in parallel, but started in the order they are listed
#       If you want output from one script to be input to another,
#       you'll need to make a wrapper script.
#       Or string them together with "script.sh && script2.sh"
#




####### Advanced fancy mail example #######

# from_email, email_passw, to_email
# Define the variables required by the compose_script
uservar=to_email test@example.com
uservar=from_email test2@example.com
uservar=from_email_passw my_secret

# If you look inside:
#   ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/catcierge/templates/compose_script.sh.in
# you can see that this script requires them, so if you omit them you'll get an
# error on startup of catcierge_grabber.

# This script uses the above user variables so we don't need to pass anything.
# We don't want to keep it so remove it when done.
# This will:
# - Generate one combined image showing all match steps
# - Zip all related files such as the generated event.json
# - Mail the result to the specified mail.
#match_group_done_cmd="%template_path:compose_script%" && rm "%template_path:compose_script%"




####### Output composed image with debug #######
#match_group_done_cmd=python ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/catcierge/catcierge-compose.py --json "%template_path:catcierge_event%" --steps --output "%match_group_id%-combined-steps.png"




####### Output composed image, no debug #######
#match_group_done_cmd=python ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/catcierge/catcierge-compose.py --json "%template_path:catcierge_event%" --output "%match_group_id%-combined.png"




####### Post the first match image to twitter #######
# Reads other info from the JSON file.
#match_group_done_cmd=python ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/catcierge/catcierge-twitter.py --json "%template_path:catcierge_event%" %match1_abs_full_path%




####### ZIP the related files #######
#match_group_done_cmd=zip -0 -r %match_group_id%.zip "%template_path:catcierge_event%" %obstruct_full_path% %match_output_path%/




####### Mail the first match image + event json #######
#match_group_done_cmd=python ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/catcierge/catcierge-sendmail-new.py --to some.dude@example.com another.dude@example.com --from cat@example.com --smtp the.server:587 --password secret --json "%template_path:catcierge_event%" --images %match1_abs_full_path% --extra "%template_path:catcierge_event%"


# NOTE !! To re-iterate, the above scripts are run in PARALLEL not in sequence !!
